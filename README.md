# miniMINER
Java implementation of the phylogenetic motif identification algorithm

Phylogenetic motifs (PMs) predict protein functional site predictions from sequence alignments. Their predictive power has been demonstrated in many investigations, especially as applied to ligand-binding and active site regions. 
The software miniMINER is a streamlined and self-contained tool for PM identification.
