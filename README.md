# miniMINER
Java implementation of the phylogenetic motif identification algorithm

Phylogenetic motifs (PMs) predict protein functional site predictions from sequence alignments. Their predictive power has been demonstrated in many investigations, especially as applied to ligand-binding and active site regions. 
The software miniMINER is a streamlined and self-contained tool for PM identification. 


You don't need to compile the code, the [executable jar file](https://github.com/etabari/miniMINER/blob/master/dist/miniminer.jar) is included in the repository


Check the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/etabari/miniMINER/wiki) for the Manual and usage
