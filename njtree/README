Clustalw2 debug setting 
=======================

Ehsan Tabari, 8/19/09


1.SETTING UP
------------

seeting up the clstalw work on your Linux/Mac OS X is quite an easy job.
download clustalw package from www.clustal.org and extract the tar.gz file.


I'll make clustalw2 but don't install it using the following command.

  ./configure
  make

the binary file is now in the src folder.
It is very conviniet to create a symlink to clustalw for furthur use:

  sudo ln -s /--path-to-the-clustal-from-system-root---/clustalw-2.0.11/src/clustalw2 /sbin/clustalw


2.DEBUG MODE
------------

all commands from now on assumes that you are in the clustal folder
files contained in this folder should be checked out to src/ folder under clustalw files
using this command:

svn co https://miniminer.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/miniminer/trunk/njtree src

furthur build could be done only by making the project.

rm src/NJTree.o
make
